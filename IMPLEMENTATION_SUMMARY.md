# Match 3 Game - Level System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Level Manager System
- **`LevelManager.gd`**: A singleton that manages all game levels
  - Loads levels from JSON files in the `levels/` directory
  - Supports multiple layout formats (string, 2D array, flat array)
  - Falls back to 5 built-in levels if no JSON files found
  - Handles level progression and tracking

### 2. JSON-Based Level Configuration
Created **10 pre-configured levels** with unique board shapes:
- `level_01.json` - Standard 8x8 grid (tutorial)
- `level_02.json` - Corners blocked
- `level_03.json` - Cross pattern
- `level_04.json` - Diamond shape
- `level_05.json` - Donut (hole in middle)
- `level_06.json` - T-shape
- `level_07.json` - Stairway pattern
- `level_08.json` - Hourglass
- `level_09.json` - Swiss cheese (multiple holes)
- `level_10.json` - Ultimate challenge

### 3. Updated Game Logic

**GameManager.gd**:
- Integrated with LevelManager
- Loads level configurations dynamically
- Handles blocked cells (`-1`) in the grid
- Updated match detection to skip blocked cells
- Modified gravity to work around holes
- Adjusted fill logic to avoid blocked positions

**GameBoard.gd**:
- Renders only non-blocked tiles
- Skips blocked cells during grid creation
- Updates visual tile positions around holes
- Handles special tile activation with blocked cells
- All syntax errors fixed (replaced `not in` with `.has()`)

**project.godot**:
- Added LevelManager as autoload singleton
- Custom splash screen configured

## Key Features

### Blocked Cells
- Represented as `-1` in the grid
- Create holes, notches, and unique board shapes
- Tiles cannot swap into blocked positions
- Matches break at blocked cells
- Gravity flows around blocked cells
- Special tiles skip blocked cells when clearing rows/columns

### Dynamic Board Sizes
- Levels can be any size (not just 8x8)
- UI automatically adapts to grid dimensions
- Tile scaling adjusts based on available space

### Easy Level Creation
Simply create a new JSON file in `levels/` directory:
```json
{
  "level": 11,
  "width": 6,
  "height": 6,
  "target_score": 15000,
  "moves": 20,
  "description": "Your custom level!",
  "layout": "0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 X X X X 0\n..."
}
```

## Testing the Levels

To test the new level system:

1. **Run the game**: The first level will load automatically
2. **Complete levels**: Reach the target score to advance
3. **View different shapes**: Each level has a unique board layout
4. **Test blocked cells**: Notice how tiles can't move through X cells

## Creating Your Own Levels

### Quick Start
1. Copy an existing level JSON file (e.g., `level_01.json`)
2. Rename it (e.g., `level_11.json`)
3. Modify the layout using:
   - `0` = normal playable cell
   - `X` = blocked cell (creates holes)
4. Adjust target_score and moves for difficulty
5. Save and run the game!

### Layout Tips
- Use `X` to create interesting shapes
- Keep at least 50% cells unblocked
- Test your levels to ensure they're beatable
- Balance target_score with available tiles

## Files Modified/Created

**New Files**:
- `scripts/LevelManager.gd` - Level management system
- `levels/level_01.json` through `level_10.json` - Pre-built levels
- `LEVELS_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

**Modified Files**:
- `scripts/GameManager.gd` - Level integration, blocked cell logic
- `scripts/GameBoard.gd` - Visual rendering of custom layouts
- `project.godot` - Added LevelManager autoload

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. ✅ Play through all 10 levels
2. ✅ Create custom levels via JSON
3. ✅ Design any board shape you want
4. ✅ Adjust difficulty per level

The system is fully functional and ready to use! All syntax errors have been fixed, and the game will properly load and display levels with holes and notches.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Consider adding:
- Level selection screen
- Level preview/thumbnail images
- Per-level tile types or colors
- Ice tiles, locked tiles, or other obstacles
- Goal-based levels (collect X of tile type Y)
- Time-based challenges
- Star rating system based on performance

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready to play!
