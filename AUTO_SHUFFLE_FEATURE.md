# Auto-Shuffle Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented an automatic board shuffle system that detects when no valid moves are available and reshuffles the board until a playable configuration is found. **Special tiles prevent shuffling** and **shuffle never creates immediate matches**.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameManager.gd

**Improved `has_possible_moves()` Function:**
- **NEW: Checks for special tiles FIRST** - if any special tile (arrow) exists, returns `true` immediately
- Special tiles (types 7-9) are always valid moves since they can be clicked to clear rows/columns
- Only checks for regular match-creating moves if no special tiles exist
- Tests all horizontal and vertical swaps for each tile
- Returns `true` only if at least one valid move exists

**Added `shuffle_board()` Function:**
- **NEW: Only shuffles regular tiles (types 1-6)** - special tiles stay in their positions
- Collects all non-blocked, non-special tile values from the grid
- Uses Godot's built-in `shuffle()` method to randomize
- Redistributes shuffled values back to their original positions
- Preserves blocked cells (doesn't shuffle them)
- **Preserves special tiles** - they remain where they were earned

**Added `has_immediate_matches()` Function:**
- **NEW: Checks if current board has any matches** without requiring a move
- Used to validate shuffle results
- Ensures shuffle doesn't accidentally create matches

**Added `shuffle_until_moves_available()` Function:**
- Attempts up to 100 shuffles to find a valid board configuration
- **NEW: Checks for immediate matches after each shuffle** - reshuffles if matches exist
- Only accepts configurations with NO immediate matches AND valid moves available
- Logs progress and attempts for debugging
- Returns `true` if successful, `false` if it exhausts attempts
- Prevents infinite loops with max attempt limit

### 2. GameBoard.gd

**Modified `process_cascade()` Function:**
- Added auto-shuffle check at the end of cascade processing
- Only triggers if no valid moves remain after cascade completes
- Ensures all animations finish before checking

**Added `perform_auto_shuffle()` Function:**
- Calls GameManager's shuffle logic
- Triggers visual shuffle animation when successful
- Provides console feedback for debugging

**Added `animate_shuffle()` Function:**
- Creates shake/wiggle effect for all tiles simultaneously
- Updates tile visuals to match new shuffled types
- Each tile:
  - Shakes randomly (±10 pixels)
  - Rotates slightly (±0.2 radians)
  - Returns smoothly to original position
- Total animation takes ~0.4 seconds
- Provides clear visual feedback that shuffle occurred

## How It Works

### Detection Flow:
1. Player makes a move and cascade completes
2. After all matches/gravity/refills finish
3. `has_possible_moves()` scans board for special tiles FIRST
4. **If special tile exists → No shuffle** (special tiles are valid moves)
5. If no special tiles, checks every possible swap (right and down from each tile)
6. If no valid moves found → trigger auto-shuffle

### Shuffle Flow:
1. **GameManager collects only regular tiles (1-6)** - special tiles excluded
2. Shuffles regular tile values randomly
3. Redistributes to board (special tiles stay in place)
4. **Checks if shuffle created matches** - if yes, reshuffle
5. Checks if valid moves exist - if no, reshuffle
6. Repeats until valid configuration found (max 100 attempts)
7. GameBoard animates all tiles with shake effect
8. Updates visual tiles to show new arrangement
9. Game continues normally with guaranteed valid moves

## Technical Details

### Valid Move Detection:
- **Priority check for special tiles** - O(n) scan before swap checks
- Tests actual match logic for each possible swap
- Uses temporary swap + match check + swap back
- More accurate than heuristic approaches
- Handles special tiles and blocked cells correctly

### Shuffle Algorithm:
- **Filters out special tiles** - only regular tiles shuffled
- O(n) collection of regular tile values
- O(n log n) shuffle using Fisher-Yates algorithm (Godot's built-in)
- O(n) redistribution to grid
- **O(n) match check** after each shuffle
- Very efficient even for large grids

### Animation:
- Parallel tweens for all tiles (smooth performance)
- Random shake prevents uniform appearance
- Short duration keeps gameplay flowing
- Clear visual feedback so player knows what happened

## User Experience

### When Shuffle DOES NOT Occur:
1. **Special tiles present**: Any arrow tile on board prevents shuffle
2. **Valid moves exist**: Regular match-creating moves available
3. **Player has agency**: Can click special tile or make regular move

### When Shuffle Occurs:
1. **Trigger**: After cascade completes with no valid moves AND no special tiles
2. **Visual**: All tiles shake/wiggle simultaneously
3. **Duration**: ~0.4 seconds total
4. **Result**: New valid move pattern guaranteed, no matches pre-created
5. **Cost**: No move penalty - shuffle is automatic and free
6. **Special tiles**: Remain in their positions (not shuffled)

### Player Benefits:
- Never stuck with unwinnable board
- Special tiles earned are preserved during shuffle
- No manual shuffle button needed (seamless)
- Smooth visual transition
- Maintains game flow without interruption
- Guaranteed clean board (no immediate matches)
- Guaranteed to find valid configuration

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Blocked Cells**: Not included in shuffle, maintain position
2. **Special Tiles**: **Not shuffled** - stay in earned positions, prevent shuffle when present
3. **Empty Cells**: Not shuffled (shouldn't exist after refill anyway)
4. **Immediate Matches**: **Detected and prevented** - reshuffle if matches created
5. **No Valid Config**: Extremely rare, but limited to 100 attempts with warning
6. **Level End**: Shuffle won't trigger if level already won/lost

## Key Behavioral Rules

### Rule 1: Special Tiles Prevent Shuffle
```gdscript
Board state: [1, 2, →, 4, 5]  # → is horizontal arrow
Valid moves check: Finds special tile
Result: No shuffle triggered (player can click arrow)
```

### Rule 2: Special Tiles Stay in Place During Shuffle
```gdscript
Before: [1, 2, →, 4, 5, ↕]  # → horizontal, ↕ 4-way
After:  [5, 1, →, 2, 4, ↕]  # Regular tiles shuffled, arrows unmoved
```

### Rule 3: Shuffle Must Not Create Matches
```gdscript
Shuffle attempt: [1, 1, 1, 4, 5]  # Created match!
Detection: has_immediate_matches() = true
Action: Reshuffle immediately
Final: [1, 4, 5, 1, 2]  # Clean board, no matches
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Normal Play**: 
   - Play through levels naturally
   - Watch for auto-shuffle when moves run out
   - Verify smooth animation

2. **Special Tile Prevention**:
   - Create board with special tile and no regular moves
   - Verify shuffle does NOT occur
   - Confirm special tile can be clicked

3. **Special Tile Preservation**:
   - Have special tile on board when shuffle triggers
   - Verify special tile stays in same position
   - Confirm regular tiles shuffle around it

4. **Match Prevention**:
   - Observe shuffle attempts in console
   - Look for "Shuffle created matches, reshuffling..." messages
   - Verify final board has no immediate matches

5. **Blocked Cells**:
   - Test on levels with many blocked cells (Level 2-10)
   - Verify blocked cells stay blocked
   - Confirm only playable tiles shuffle
