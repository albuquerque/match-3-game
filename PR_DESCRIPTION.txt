PR Title: Experience runtime pipeline refactor — extract flow step definitions, add schemas & tooling

Branch context
- This branch was created on top of the "Experience system refactor" commit (the refactor that introduced the initial runtime pipeline). The work here continues that effort: we expanded `NodeTypeStepFactory`, implemented previously stubbed step types, and also added JSON schemas, migration tooling, and documentation to make flows and step definitions first-class and machine-consumable.

PR Description:
Overview
- This PR refactors the game's experience runtime pipeline to move step definitions out of inline experience flows into a new `data/flow_step_definitions/` directory and introduces a first-class runtime pipeline implementation under `scripts/runtime_pipeline/`.
- Adds dedicated step implementations and loaders so flows can reference reusable step definitions by name. This reduces orchestration coupling and prepares the codebase for AI-driven flow generation.

Key changes
- New runtime pipeline loader and step implementations:
  - scripts/runtime_pipeline/FlowStepDefinitionLoader.gd (new)
  - scripts/runtime_pipeline/NodeTypeStepFactory.gd (modified)
  - scripts/runtime_pipeline/ExperiencePipeline.gd (modified)
  - scripts/runtime_pipeline/steps/* (new step types: AdRewardStep, ConditionalStep, CutsceneStep, DLCFlowStep, PremiumGateStep, UnlockStep, etc.)
- Data migration and definition files:
  - data/flow_step_definitions/ (new) — ad_reward.json, narrative_stage.json, narrative_stage_1/2.json, reward_coins.json, etc.
  - data/experience_flows/test_definition_flow.json (new) — example flow using external step definitions
  - tools/migrate_flow_definitions*.py (new) — CLI tools to migrate inline flows to definition files
- JSON schemas & docs for AI consumption:
  - docs/schemas/*.json (new) — effect, experience_flow, flow_step_definition, narrative_stage, level, chapter, collection, dlc_manifest
  - docs/JSON_FILE_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/JSON_ARCHITECTURE_GUARDRAILS.md (new)
  - docs/AI_FLOW_PROMPT.md (new) — example prompt tuned for current content (Book of Genesis)
- Definition auditing & editor tooling:
  - addons/definition_audit/ and tools/editor/definition_audit.gd (new)
  - tools/check_definition_refs.py, tools/validate_flow.py, tools/verify_definitions.py (new)
- Various narrative and flow JSON updates and tests:
  - data/experience_flows/* (modified/added)
  - data/narrative_stages/* (modified)
- Game integration updates:
  - scripts/ExperienceDirector.gd, scripts/FlowCoordinator.gd — updated to integrate with new pipeline
  - scenes/TestDefinitionRunner.tscn + scripts/test_definition_runner.gd (new) — test harness

Reference commit
- Base HEAD SHA: 54686f75e885c788dae8cba3637ac5d00ba0386c

Notes / Testing
- I restored the original `scripts/GameBoard.gd` border helpers from HEAD and fixed an indentation-related parse error in `_destroy_tiles_immediately`.
- Please run the project in Godot and smoke-test the following flows:
  1) Open `scenes/TestDefinitionRunner.tscn` and run the test harness to verify step definitions load correctly.
  2) Load any narrative stage (e.g. `data/narrative_stages/levels/level_11.json`) and confirm the narrative pipeline shows the full-screen narrative between level load and gameplay.
  3) Run the migration CLI `tools/migrate_flow_definitions.py` against a test experience flow and inspect `data/flow_step_definitions/` for correct output.

If you want, I can now:
- Commit these staged changes with a suggested commit message and push to the current branch.
- Open a draft PR branch and set the PR description accordingly.
