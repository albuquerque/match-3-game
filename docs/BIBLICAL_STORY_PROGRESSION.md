- **Score-based:** Advance at score milestones
- **Manual:** Tap to advance through stages

**Recommended Approach:**
```json
{
  "narrative_stage": "creation_day_1",
  "progression": {
    "type": "time",
    "stages": [
      { "duration": 3, "visual": "darkness" },
      { "duration": 2, "visual": "first_light" },
      { "duration": 2, "visual": "light_burst" },
      { "duration": 3, "visual": "separated" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Visual Effect Techniques:**
- Fade transitions between stages
- Particle effects (light, water, fire, smoke)
- Color grading shifts
- Layered image reveals
- Animated overlays
- Camera movements (zoom, pan)
