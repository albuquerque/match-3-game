# Level Completion Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive level completion system that displays results after cascade animations complete, with appropriate buttons for winning or losing.

## Changes Made

### 1. GameManager.gd
**Added Level Completion State Variables:**
- `last_level_won`: Boolean indicating if the level was completed successfully
- `last_level_score`: Final score achieved in the level
- `last_level_target`: Target score required for the level
- `last_level_number`: The level number that just finished
- `last_level_moves_left`: Remaining moves when level completed

**Updated Functions:**
- `add_score()`: Now stores level completion state when target is reached
- `use_move()`: Stores failure state when moves run out, triggers level failed transition
- `on_level_complete()`: Transitions to LevelProgressScene with completion data
- `on_level_failed()`: New function that waits for animations then transitions to results
- Added missing `get_tile_at()` and `reset_combo()` functions

**Key Features:**
- All cascade animations complete before transitioning to results screen
- Level state is preserved (win/lose, score, moves) for display
- Prevents multiple simultaneous level transitions with `level_transitioning` flag

### 2. LevelProgress.gd
**Complete Rewrite:**
- Now has dual functionality: level selection OR results display
- Detects if coming from game completion/failure by checking GameManager state
- Shows appropriate UI based on context

**New UI Elements:**
- `ResultPanel`: Displays level results with score information
- `result_title`: Shows "Level X Complete!" (green) or "Level X Failed" (red)
- `score_label`: Displays final score
- `target_label`: Shows target score for reference
- `moves_label`: Shows moves left (or "Out of Moves!" on failure)
- `next_level_button`: Visible only on success
- `restart_button`: Visible only on failure
- `menu_button`: Always available to return to main menu

**Button Actions:**
- Next Level: Loads the already-advanced level from GameManager
- Restart Level: Resets to the failed level and reloads it
- Main Menu: Returns to main menu (future implementation)

### 3. LevelProgressScene.tscn
**Added Complete Result Panel UI:**
- Panel with centered VBoxContainer layout
- Large title label (36pt font)
- Score display (24pt font)
- Target and moves labels (20pt font)
- Spacer for visual separation
- Action buttons (60px height for easy touch)
- Menu button (50px height)
- All with proper sizing and alignment

**Layout:**
- ResultPanel positioned at center of screen (600x500px)
- Proper padding (20px) inside panel
- Color-coded title based on win/lose state
- Initially hidden, shown when needed

### 4. GameBoard.gd
**Fixed Type Hints:**
- Removed explicit `Tile` type hints that were causing compilation errors
- Now uses duck typing for tile objects
- Changed function signatures to use untyped parameters where needed

**Cascade Completion:**
- All cascade animations properly awaited before level end checks
- `process_cascade()` completes all match/gravity/refill cycles
- Level completion/failure only triggers after all animations finish

## User Experience Flow

### Level Success:
1. Player reaches target score during gameplay
2. Final cascade animations complete (matches, gravity, refills)
3. GameManager stores success state
4. Transition to LevelProgressScene (0.5s delay for polish)
5. Results screen shows:
   - "Level X Complete!" in green
   - Final score achieved
   - Target score reference
   - Moves remaining
   - "Next Level" button
   - "Main Menu" button

### Level Failure:
1. Player runs out of moves without reaching target
2. Final cascade animations complete
3. GameManager stores failure state
4. Transition to LevelProgressScene (0.5s delay)
5. Results screen shows:
   - "Level X Failed" in red
   - Final score achieved
   - Target score missed
   - "Out of Moves!" message
   - "Restart Level" button
   - "Main Menu" button

## Technical Details

### Animation Synchronization:
- Uses Godot's `await` system for proper async handling
- All match/destroy/gravity/refill animations complete before transition
- Minimum 0.5 second delay ensures smooth visual feedback

### State Management:
- `level_transitioning` flag prevents race conditions
- Level state persists through scene changes via autoload GameManager
- LevelManager tracks current level independently

### Error Handling:
- Checks for null/missing nodes before accessing
- Validates GameManager state before showing results
- Fallback to route map if no completion state exists

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Win Condition**: Play a level and complete it successfully
   - Verify all cascade animations finish
   - Check result screen shows correct score/moves
   - Confirm "Next Level" button advances properly

2. **Lose Condition**: Exhaust moves without reaching target
   - Verify animations complete
   - Check result screen shows failure state
   - Confirm "Restart Level" properly reloads the same level

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Win on the very last move
   - Large cascade at level end
   - Multiple special tile activations before level end

## Future Enhancements

- Stars/rating system based on performance
- Level unlock progression
- Statistics tracking (best score, completion time)
- Animation effects for level transitions
- Sound effects for level completion/failure
