# Changelog

All notable changes to the Match-3 Game project.

## [Unreleased] - February 2026

### Added
- **Narrative Effects System** - Complete implementation for local and DLC levels
  - 14 effect executors (background_dim, vignette, screen_flash, camera_impulse, shader_param_lerp, play_animation, timeline_sequence, state_swap, screen_overlay, narrative_dialogue, spawn_particles, foreground_dim, background_tint, progressive_brightness)
  - Screen overlay with texture and tint support
  - Narrative dialogue system with title/message parameters
  - Timeline sequence for multi-step chained effects
  - State swap for visibility/position swapping
  - All effects working on both local and DLC levels
  - Demo levels (1-6, 31) showcasing various effects

- **Sample Overlay Textures** - 3 SVG textures for screen overlays
  - `overlay_vignette.svg` - Dark edges effect
  - `overlay_victory_rays.svg` - Radiating golden light
  - `overlay_sparkles.svg` - Scattered stars celebration

- **Spreader Tiles System** - Special mechanic tiles
  - Configurable grace moves before spreading (1-2 moves)
  - Controlled spread rate (1 tile per turn or all adjacent)
  - Track spreader count for level completion goals
  - Spreader-specific narrative effects integration
  - Level 31 demo implementation

- **HUD Enhancements**
  - Rounded translucent background panel for HUD elements
  - Registered as VisualAnchor "hud" for narrative effects targeting
  - Professional polished appearance with subtle borders

### Fixed
- **Godot 4.5 Compatibility** - All narrative effects updated for Godot 4 APIs
  - `Animation.loop_mode = Animation.LOOP_NONE` instead of `loop = false`
  - `AnimationLibrary + add_animation_library()` instead of `add_animation()`
  - Shader loading via `FileAccess` + `Shader.new().code` pattern
  - SVG texture loading via `FileAccess.file_exists()` + `load()`
  - Removed all deprecated `find_node()` calls
  - Safe tree access patterns via viewport
  - Lambda callbacks in timeline_sequence instead of unsafe await

- **State Management Between Levels**
  - HUD visibility automatically restored on every level load
  - GameBoard position reset to (0,0) on level transitions
  - Visual overlays properly cleaned up between levels
  - No state leakage from previous levels

- **Level Transition Screen** - Visibility timing issues
  - Transition screen appears immediately on level complete
  - Fixed `await` blocking visibility change
  - Proper effect cleanup before transition

- **Particle System** - Coordinate system and positioning
  - Particles spawn at correct tile world positions
  - Fixed top-left corner spawning bug
  - Proper tile-to-world coordinate conversion

- **Gravity System** - Tile refill and animation
  - Tiles animate smoothly when dropping after matches
  - No flying upward tiles
  - Proper cascade refill behavior
  - Fixed empty gaps on board

- **Unmovable Tiles** - Consolidated implementation
  - Removed UNMOVABLE_SOFT (use UNMOVABLE_HARD with H1 notation)
  - All level files updated to H1/H2/H3 notation
  - Fixed destruction counting and tracking
  - Proper adjacent match detection and clearing

- **Lightning Special Tiles** - Immediate tile destruction
  - Tiles destroyed instantly as lightning beam passes
  - Cascading lightning activation works correctly
  - No delayed destruction animations

- **Bonus Moves Counter** - Negative value prevention
  - Counter stops at 0 instead of going negative
  - Proper move counting during special tile chains
  - Accurate move display during bonus cascade

- **Narrative Dialogue** - Parameter support
  - Supports both `title`/`message` AND `character`/`text` parameters
  - Backward compatible with both naming conventions
  - Messages display correctly in dialog boxes

- **Screen Overlay** - Tint persistence bug
  - Fixed tint overlays staying on screen permanently
  - Proper fade-in → hold → fade-out → cleanup sequence
  - ColorRect correctly animated and removed

### Changed

  - All documentation moved to `docs/` directory
  - Only `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` remain in root

  - Created `docs/archive/fixes_2026_02_02/` for Feb 2 fixes
  - Updated `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` with current structure
  - Consolidated 20 individual fix docs into comprehensive guides

- **Level Configuration Files** - Updated formats
  - Levels 1-6 configured with narrative effect demos
  - Level 31 showcases spreader mechanics
  - All levels use H1/H2/H3 notation for unmovables
  - Removed legacy "U" notation for soft unmovables
